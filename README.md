##Eleven Fifty Academy SD69 Agile/Sprint Exercise

#AGILEGroceryList WebApi

At the start of the project, our first hurdle was that we could not get Trello to work, so we adapted and went to a similar service, Asana.

After that, we decided step one would be to discuss and agree on what data points/props should be associated with each class.

We ended up with these user stories:  

*User selects a Recipe and get a grocery List
*User selects multiple Recipes and get a combined grocery list
*User enters and saves a Recipe
*User enters a TimeToPrepare and gets fast recipes
*User rates a Recipe
*User enters a rating level and gets good Recipes
*User saves a Meal by Adding multiple recipes to it
*Mutliple users select a Meal and each prepare one of the Recipes for a gathering (post COVID) like a wedding registry
*User enters or selects a Recipe and is given the cheapest store in the area in which to purchase the ingredients (big stretch)
*User adds instructions/tips to Recipe
*User enters and saves a list of staples that they purchase every time that they want on their list regardless of recipes selected or entered


These items were then turned into tickets.  We only used a four point system, becuase of the problems with Trello and the Fibonacci system not being built into Asana.

Our tickets were:

*Outline for ingredients and recipes
*Build scaffolding and initialize Github project
*Ingredients Build
*Recipe data references
*Add recipe method
*Recipe enter and save
*Meal created or pulled by selecting recipes
*Add ratings to recipes by user and average
*Add staples to grocery list, by user
*Add finish times to recipes
*Grocery list build
*Incoming/Outgoing Volume/Mass conversions

 
Our Test Items were all CRUD methods for

*Ingredient
*Recipe
*GroceryList
 

Our "Epics" were

*Create a User Interface for the app
*Publish the app on a major platform
*Monetize the app
